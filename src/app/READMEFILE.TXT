Hello this is my final project for the class cs 220 web development
Doing the whole pages has taken most of my time in the last 2 days, and i still havent completed them
but i hope this is enough to pass the class

the about page is done (since it was the simplest)
the home page including the header and footer , 
and half of the other things is also done. 
I will be continuing working on this tomorrow 

Although I am sending this files becuase I have a feeling that I maybe be failing the class if not
